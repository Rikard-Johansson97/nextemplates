## 📜 Prerequisites

Before wielding this powerful extension, ensure you've mastered the scrolls of Next.js and React. If these aren't in your grimoire yet, best obtain them first.

## 🔮 Usage

1. **Installation**: Invoke the **NexTemplates** extension from the VS Code marketplace.
2. **Casting Spells**: In any `typescript` file, type your chosen prefix (like `npc` for a new page component). Hit `Tab`, and watch the magic unfold.
3. **Customization**: Each spell (snippet) contains placeholders (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) that guide your incantations. Navigate between them using the `Tab` key to customize the generated component.

## 📌 Enhancements

1. **GitHub Copilot Synergy**: Combine the might of **NexTemplates** with [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) to ascend to coding divinity. Let Copilot complete your spells and incantations, making the coding process truly ethereal.

2. **Optimal Setting**: To ensure your spells are woven seamlessly, consider setting `"editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": true` in your VS Code settings. This arcane tweak ensures that the auto-suggestions don't interfere with the magic of your snippets.

## 🎉 Concluding the Ritual

With **NexTemplates**, each line of code feels like a mystical chant, and redundant code becomes folklore. Embrace the enchantment and let your Next.js journey be filled with wonder.

May your code be forever enchanted! ✨
